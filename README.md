# Overview

This repository contains a collection of modular patches for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com), initially created as part of the Sound Synthesis course (ME1614) at the Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). The goal of this project is to make music and sound design techniques more accessible by open-sourcing these patches, providing a practical way to explore fundamental concepts of sound synthesis and demonstrating how specific sounds are created in a modular environment.

# Usage
