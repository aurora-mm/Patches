# Overview

This repository includes modular patches for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com), initially created as part of the coursework for the Sound Synthesis course (ME1614) at the Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). By making music and sound design open source, it becomes easier to explain fundamental concepts of sound synthesis and demonstrate how specific sounds are created.
